# Project Guidelines for The Open Codex

Welcome to **The Open Codex**! To maintain consistency and quality across our growing universe, we ask that all contributors follow these project guidelines. This ensures that everything we create fits together cohesively and contributes to an immersive world-building experience.

## General Guidelines

- **Be Respectful**: We encourage collaboration and discussion, so be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- **Collaborate**: This is a community project, and collaboration is key. Share your ideas, ask for feedback, and be open to suggestions.
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Aim for thoughtful and well-written contributions. If you're unsure about something, feel free to ask for help or clarification.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that your contributions are consistent with the existing lore. Avoid introducing elements that conflict with established facts unless it's part of a larger narrative change.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Tone and Style**: The Open Codex is an open world with a variety of tones, but it generally leans toward serious, high-stakes storytelling. However, don't be afraid to inject humor, intrigue, or mystery where appropriate.
- **Character Depth**: Characters should have motivations, weaknesses, and flaws. The more complex they are, the more interesting they will be in the world.
- **Lore Integrity**: New lore should fit within the established world. If you're unsure, check existing content for examples, or reach out to the community for feedback.
- **World-Building**: When creating new factions, characters, or locations, ensure they make sense in the broader context of the world. Consider how they interact with other factions, characters, and locations.

## Specific Guidelines for Lore Contributions

- **Faction Contributions**: Provide a history, culture, leadership structure, and any notable events related to the faction.
- **Character Contributions**: Characters should have a backstory, personality traits, relationships, and a purpose in the world. They should tie into the larger narrative of the project.
- **World Contributions**: Each world or location should be fleshed out with history, geography, and significance. Describe how it fits into the larger world, what role it plays, and who inhabits it.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: When committing changes, write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the changes.
- **Small Pull Requests**: Make pull requests small and manageable. Large pull requests can be difficult to review effectively.
- **Respect the Review Process**: When your pull request is reviewed, be open to feedback. The goal is to improve the quality of the lore and contribute to the overall vision of The Open Codex.
