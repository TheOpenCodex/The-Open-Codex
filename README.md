# The-Open-Codex
The Open Codex is a community-driven, open-source lore-building project where imagination has no limits. Together, weâ€™re crafting an expansive, interconnected universe of factions, characters, worlds, and histories. Every contribution adds to the tapestry of this shared world, making it a living, collaborative work of creativity.
